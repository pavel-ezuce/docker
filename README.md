Init
====

You need to have Docker version at least 1.9.0 (as this setup relies on docker network heavily) and git installed


git clone https://github.com/swarmcom/docker-init.git


next run 

./install.sh


You can also build each docker image alone from the correct folder with ./build.sh or start it with ./run.sh
